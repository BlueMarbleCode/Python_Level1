# ===================================================================
# Write a while loop that keeps asking the user to type "hello" until they do.

# Use a for loop to print each number in a list, but stop if the number is greater than 10.

numbers = [3, 7, 12, 5, 9, 15]

for number in numbers:
    # Write your code here
    pass  # Remove this and add your code


# EXTRA CHALLENGE:
# Write a loop that prints the following pattern of alternating X's and O's:
# 
# X O X O X
# O X O X O
# X O X O X
# O X O X O
# X O X O X
#
# Hint: Use a counter variable to alternate between printing "X" and "O".
